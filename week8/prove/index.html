        For example, say your developers have come up with the perfect amortization program and you want to install it
        on the workgroup server for other systems to remotely mount and use. Because this is a third-party or custom
        application, the logical place for it is in <span class="mono">/usr/local/appname</span> possibly with a link to
        the program binary in
        the <span class="mono">/usr/local/bin directory</span> (because that's in the path).

            If given a choice between putting the software package <span class="bold caps">bigprog</span> in the <span
                class="bold">/usr/local/<span class="caps">bigprog</span></span> section and the
            <span class="bold">/opt/<span class="caps">bigprog</span></span> section, it's hard to choose. Read any
            relevant exam question closely--the main difference
            being that the <span class="bold">/opt</span> section is not considered to be sharable, whereas the <span
                class="bold">/usr</span> section is often shared and
            mounted by client systems.

    <h1>File Management Commands</h1>
    <p>
        A major section of the 101 exam is dedicated to how to run commands properly with the right options and
        arguments. As a good sysadmin, you'll be expected to know how to create, delete, edit, set permissions on,
        display, move, copy, and determine the type of files and programs.
    </p>
    <div class="alert-note">
        <p>Alert</p>
        <p>
            You must be able to pick proper and working commands out of lists of possibilities, type in appropriate
            strings in fill-in-the-blank boxes, and in general show that you've run the programs and utilities in
            question.

    <h2>Tips for working with Linux files</h2>
    <p>
        Because most users and sysadmins come from a Windows or other OS background, a quick set of recommendations for
        the less-experienced can be of help here:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">> Hidden files aren't really hidden</span> - They just begin with a ., such as the <span
            class="mono">.bashrc</span> and <span class="mono">.bash_profile</span> files.
        These are not viewable by normal users with conventional commands and switches and aren't deleted by commands
        such as <span class="mono">rm -f *.*</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">> Filenames can contain multiple periods or no period characters</span> - The filenames <span
            class="mono">this.is.a.long.file</span> and
        <span class="mono">thisisalongfile</span> are perfectly reasonable and possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">> Spaces in filenames look nice, but are a pain to type</span> - Use an _ or a - instead of
        spaces because it's neater
        and easier than prefixing all spaces with a \. (To display a space in a filename, the system shows a space
        prefixes with a backslash.)
